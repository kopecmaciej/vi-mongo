## What's New

### Features

- **Multiple Document Selection**
  - Added support for selecting and deleting multiple documents at once
  - Use `V` to enter selection mode and select documents
  - Press `Esc` to clear selection
  - Delete multiple selected documents with a single action
  - **Selection Priority**: When documents are selected, delete operations will only affect selected documents. Delete operations on the document under cursor only work when nothing is selected
  - Note: Multi-selection is not available in JSON view mode
  - New keybindings for multiple selection/clear selection

  ```json
        "multipleSelect": {
            "runes": [
                "V"
            ],
            "description": "Multiple select"
        },
        "clearSelection": {
            "keys": [
                "Esc"
            ],
            "description": "Clear selection"
        }

  ```

- **Enhanced Security**
  - Added optional password encryption for MongoDB connection credentials
  - Passwords can now be encrypted and stored securely in configuration files
  - Support for encryption keys via environment variables or key files
  - Automatic encryption/decryption when adding and using connections
  
  **⚠️ Important Notice**: Password encryption is currently optional, but will become the standard method for handling passwords in future releases. This wasn't made mandatory in this version to allow time for proper app preparation and ensure a smooth transition for all users.
  
  For detailed setup instructions, see the [Security Documentation](https://github.com/kopecmaciej/vi-mongo/blob/master/docs/security.md)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed connection configuration: changed `url` field to `uri` in connection page for consistency (not yet changed in config.yaml)
- Reduced log spam by fixing MongoDB collection index stats authorization warnings (now shows single warning instead of multiple messages)
- Fixed CLI message printing issues when using command-line interface
- Improved overall logging behavior and message handling
